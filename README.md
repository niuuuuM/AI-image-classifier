# Dog vs Mouse Classifier 🐶🐭

This is a simple AI project that classifies images into **Dog** or **Mouse** categories.  
The model was trained using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and converted to TensorFlow Lite for use in Python.

## Features
- TensorFlow Lite model integration
- Simple image classification with Python
- Supports JPG/PNG images
